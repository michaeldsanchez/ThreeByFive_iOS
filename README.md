## ThreeByFive

### App Description
Study effectively with ThreeByFive, an app that will let you create flashcards from material of your choosing. Multiple choice options will test your knowledge as you study and indicate when you've answered correctly. Take your study material everywhere you go with ThreeByFive for iOS!

### App Walk-though
Tap on the flashcard to reveal the correct answer, tap again to display the question. Tapping on incorrect multiple choice options will remove those options. Tapping the correct answer will display the back side of the flashcard. Tapping anywhere on the background will reset the multiple choice questions so that you can keep studying!
